# Application to identify bumblebees, will hopefully work similar to a field guide :)

## :construction: WIP on login & database setup with firestore and firebase.

#### A special thanks to Robin Wieruch and the **Road to React with Firebase** which has been a great help in setting up the project

#### This is just a sandbox / learning by doing project, focus for now is on creating logins and a database.

### TODO (in the nearest future):

- firebase & realtime DB
- migrating from realtime DB to Firestore
- classbased to functional components
