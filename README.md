# :bee: Application to identify bumblebees, will hopefully work similar to a field guide :)

## :construction: WIP migrating to NextJS and Strapi.

#### This is just a sandbox / learning by doing project, focus for now is on creating logins and a database.

#### :email: Write an email to mrautenberg@outlook.com if you have any questions, ideas or just want to get in touch.

### TODO (in the nearest future):

- [ ] Changing react to next & firebase to strapi
- [ ] UI fixes (just to make it somewhat less ugly when testing out stuff)
- [ ] Figma sketch and UX research
