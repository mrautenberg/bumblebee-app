## :construction: WIP on login & database setup with firestore and firebase.

#### A special thanks to Robin Wieruch and the **Road to React with Firebase** which has been a great help in setting up the project

#### This is just a sandbox / learning by doing project, focus for now is on creating logins and a database.

#### :email: Write an email to mrautenberg@outlook.com if you have any questions, ideas or just want to get in touch.

### TODO (in the nearest future):

- [x] firebase & realtime DB
- [x] migrating from realtime DB to Firestore
- [ ] class based to functional components
- [ ] UI fixes (just to make it somewhat less ugly when testing out stuff)
- [ ] Figma sketch and UX research
